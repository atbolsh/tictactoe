I had forgotten all ttt strategy.

Briefly, I saw that safe first moves at first are center / corners, 
while safe responses are center (to corners) or corners (only to center!)

Then, forks are the way to go, but the first player can't reliably do this 
without setting up 2 in a row for the second player.

EDGES ARE BAD INITIALLY (first move for each player).


A blog I saw recommended playing corners as the first player, cause that gives 
novices more bad choices. 
I'm gonna try to play that imperfect game against the system, and see if it learns good strategy.


That will be the start / debugging. Pitting them against each other will be only the final thing I do.

After pitting them against each other / itself, I will also see what modifications I can make to prevent collapse of play.

The code itself should be easy: use existing functions to spit out all possible moves, list all possible 1-step futures, compare the value . . .
